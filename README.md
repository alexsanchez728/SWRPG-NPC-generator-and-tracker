## Description
A web-app for Galaxy Masters across the universe to generate NPCs (non-playable-characters) of their own design. Save them to a personal library and deploy in groups to battle! Damage, stamina, stats, and effects are all updated in real-time on the battle page. An app for Galaxy Masters to keep active on their phone, tablet, or laptop as battles rage on.
  
> Create, name, customize, edit, and delete units with stats of your own creation
  
> Damage and effects update on the battle page in real-time, no need to hit a save button every time a change is made
  
> Assign units to groups to keep track of which unit is going first, second, and so on in a battle
  
> Store units you have used previously in the event you want to have them appear later in the game
  
#### Why?
In a game of the tabletop Star Wars Role Playing game there is the Galaxy Master, who runs the game and the story, and the Player Characters. Galaxy masters must keep track of everything that is going on in a scene and when it comes to battles between the players and groups of imperial forces or worse, a squad of trandoshan bounty hunters, the GM must keep track of the imperials' health, stats, etc.
  
Traditionally this requires a stack of index cards that are being written on and earased as the battle rages on. And for a game about the technologically advanced universe of Star Wars it felt strange that there were few options to keep track of these things online.
  
  
## Demo
To log in and use the app for the first time you must sign in with a Google account as OAuth is used to keep users separate.
